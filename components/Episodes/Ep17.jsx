          <blockquote className="confer-blockquote">
            <h5>
            If you don't define your life, somebody else will define it for you, your decision will be making no decisions you have to decide that I'm gonna start doing these things and you've to take that action to do them and so for me when I think about those two things its like the result that I want to achieve is happiness, like I found no other higher bar to live more than happiness, what's the point of anything, if you're Misérables, if it's a grind you are hatern, "Leave me alone I'm making millions", what's the point?, if you're just angry pissed off, wealthy person billionaire in hospital that everybody hates, what's the point right?, and you even hate it, what's the point?. So for me the ultimate goal is happiness and if you look to other people like the Dalai lama also says "This is the purpose of life", is to be happy.
